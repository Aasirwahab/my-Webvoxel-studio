## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. We recommend using `pnpm` as your package manager.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webvoxel-studio.git
   cd webvoxel-studio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following keys. You will need to get these from your Clerk and Convex dashboards.
   
   ```env
   # Clerk Auth
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

   # Convex
   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_deployment
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. In a new terminal, run the Convex development server (to sync database changes):
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
